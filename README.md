This repo is collection of all Machine Learning Algorithms Implemented using Just Python, Numpy and Math.

## Machine Learning Workflow

Problem → Data → Preprocessing → Vectorization → Model → Evaluation → Deployment



| Step No. | Step Name | What Happens Here |
|:---|:---|:---|
| 1 | **Problem Definition** | Understand the problem. What are you trying to predict/classify? |
| 2 | **Data Collection** | Gather raw data (CSV files, databases, APIs, images, etc.). |
| 3 | **Data Preprocessing** | Clean data (handle missing values, remove duplicates, fix errors). |
| 4 | **Data Exploration (EDA)** | Analyze data: plots, correlations, distributions (to understand patterns). |
| 5 | **Feature Engineering** | Create new features, select important ones, transform inputs. |
| 6 | **Data Splitting** | Split into Training, Validation, and Test sets (e.g., 70%-20%-10%). |
| 7 | **Model Selection** | Choose a model type (e.g., Decision Tree, SVM, Neural Network). |
| 8 | **Training the Model** | Fit (train) the model on the training data. |
| 9 | **Model Evaluation** | Check how good it is (using validation data and metrics like accuracy, RMSE, F1-score, etc.). |
| 10 | **Hyperparameter Tuning** | Optimize settings to improve performance (Grid Search, Random Search). |
| 11 | **Testing** | Final check on the unseen test data. |
| 12 | **Deployment** | Deploy the model into production (web app, API, etc.). |
| 13 | **Monitoring and Maintenance** | Watch the model over time and retrain if performance drops. |
